    <h2 class="display-3 my-4 text-info">Daisies</h2>
    <p class="text-start">
      <ul>
        <li>There are about 20 types of daisies. Some of them are very different from each other. However, they have one important similarity – a strong smell. Another name of the daisy flower is chamomile.</li><li>All of them bloom in the first year of life. The flowers of all daisies look quite similar.</li><li>The most common chamomile on earth is Matricaria chamomilla. Surely you’ve seen it, it’s a flower with white petals. It grows all over the world, with the exception of the Arctic and tropical regions, because the climate there is unsuitable for it.</li><li>Matricaria chamomilla is one of the most widely used medicinal plants in the world. Botanists and doctors have written more scientific papers about it than about any other plant.</li><li>Daisy seeds can be stored for a long time in dried form, and they won’t lose their ability to germinate. According to scientific research, chamomile seeds germinate with a 50% chance after 8 years of storage.</li></ul></p><br>


  <h2 class="display-3 my-4 text-info">Roses</h2>
  <p class="text-start"> 
  <ul>
<li>2004 was the year when the world got its 1st blue rose after years of persistence, wherein the breeders tried to genetically manipulate different species and colours of roses.</li>

<li>After spending 15 years and $ 4.37 million, famous rose breeder David Austin sold his Juliet Rose, also referred to as “£3 million rose’’, in 2006 at the Chelsea Flower Show. Juliet Rose is termed as the most expensive rose ever developed.</li>

<li>One of the miniature roses is termed “Overnight Scentsation” as it was taken to space by the researchers to learn how gravity impacted rose’s scent.</li>

<li>Throughout the world, there are approximately about 150 species of roses and thousands of hybrids.</li>  

<li>The rose is the national flower emblem of the United States since 20th Nov 1986 after President Ronald Reagan officially declared this, while standing in the famous White House Rose Garden.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="display-3 my-4 text-info">Tulips</h2>
  <p class="text-start"> 
  <ul>
  <li>There are over 150 species of tulips, with over 3,000 naturally occurring and genetically cultivated varieties. New varieties are still being created, but it takes at least 20 years of cultivation before you will find them in your local florist’s shop.</li>
<li>Tulips are native to central Asia. It wasn’t until 1594 that the first tulip ‘officially’ bloomed in Holland after the Flemish botanist, Carolus Clusius, director of Leiden University’s new Hortus Botanicus, planted some of his own tulip bulbs.</li>
<li>The name ‘Tulip’ originated from the Persian word ‘delband’ meaning turban, given the flowers turban shape. Another reason for its association with Turkey is because locals would often decorate their turbans with tulip stems.</li>
<li>Tulips are related to another popular spring flower, the lily. They are part of the Liliaceae family, as are lilies, onions, garlic and asparagus (another Dutch favourite).</li>
<li>At one point in history, tulips were the most expensive flower in the world. Between 1634 and 1637 it is said tulips cost almost 10 times what an average working-class man earned in a year; this time period was known as “Tulip Mania”.</li></ul>
</p><br>

<h2 class="display-3 my-4 text-info">Succulents</h2>
  <p class="text-start"> 
  <ul>
  <li>You may think of succulents as a single family, but the truth is that there are more than 60 different families of succulents. In fact, there are approximately 10,000 plant varieties that you can grow. Some of these are common like the cactus or the aloe plant, while there are also several uncommon succulents that will look beautiful in your garden.</li>
  <li>Succulents grow in a variety of colors and textures. Of course, shades of green are going to be the most common, but these plants can also have shades of pink, blue, purple, yellow, red, and orange in the leaves and the blooms.</li>
  <li>Succulents originate from hot areas of the world like Africa and South America, so they are able to grow well in conditions that are dry without much water. This is mainly because their leaves hold nutrients to be released when the plant is lacking water. Because of this, you should only need to water these plants about twice a month or when the soil that it is planted in is completely dry.</li>
  <li>Many succulents can survive living in cold climates as well as hot ones, which means that they can grow in nearly every part of the country. Many succulents will live through freezing temperatures and the ground being covered with snow, but what most people do not realize is that some cacti can survive these conditions as well.</li>
  <li>The chalky substance that can be found on the leaves of these plants is designed to protect the plant from the sun.
